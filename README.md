### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This program demonstrates how to write, append, and read data from a file in Python.

How it works:
- The user is asked to enter some text, which is written to a file named `output.txt`.
- Then, the user is prompted to enter more text, which is appended to the same file.
- Finally, the program reads and displays the entire content of `output.txt`.

### Task 1: Read a Text File with Error Handling
This program opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt` and handles any errors if the file is missing.

How it works:
- The program tries to open `sample.txt` in read mode.
- If the file exists, it prints its content line by line.
- If the file does not exist, it prints a user-friendly error message using a `try-except` block.
